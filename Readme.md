## FAQ
### My/someone's node does not show up
It is possible that someone's node is missing. That can happens for a few reasons:

- The thesis (*thesis*, not *person*) is not tagged with "cryptographie", "cryptanalyse", "cryptologie" or "cryptographie quantique" on Theses.fr.
- The person behind a thesis does not have a dedicated page on Theses.fr.

### My/someone's node shows invalid/incomplete/out of date information
Is is most probably not a problem with cryptomap. The information on Theses.fr can be incomplete, [but you can fix it yourself](https://theses.fr/signaler).
