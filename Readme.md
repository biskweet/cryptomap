# Cryptomap 🗺️

A fun visualization of academic cryptography in France, showing the genealogy of PhD students.

All data is regularly updated from the source, Theses.fr.

## FAQ
### My/someone's node does not appear on the visualization
It is possible that someone's node is missing. That can happens for a few reasons:
- The thesis does not exist in the source -- this is common for theses defended before 1985.
- The thesis (*thesis*, not *person*) is not labeled with monitored tags (namely "cryptographie", "cryptanalyse", "cryptologie" or "cryptographie quantique").
- The person behind a thesis does not have a dedicated page on Theses.fr (usual symptom: the person name shows up as plaintext on the thesis webpage, not as a hyperlink).

### My/someone's node shows invalid/incomplete/out of date information
Is is most probably not a problem with cryptomap. The information on Theses.fr can be incomplete, [but you can fix it yourself](https://theses.fr/signaler).
